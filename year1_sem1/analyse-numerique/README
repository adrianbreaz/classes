Numerical Methods class.

Mostly Matlab/Octave code.

Contents
*. Cholesky:
    - implementation of the Cholesky method of solving linear equation systems.
    - includes functions to solve triangular systems.
    - properly tested
    - found at http://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/~cuvelier/MACS1/TP1/Cholesky.tar.gz

*. Homework:
    - see http://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/~cuvelier/MACS1/TP1/TP1.pdf
    - for those too lazy: implements Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, S.O.R. and Richardson
    iterative methods for solving linear equation systems.
    - properly tested
    - includes functions for generating all kinds of random matrices.

*. TP2
    - implements the Lagrange interpolation.
    - also with points generated by Chebyshev
    - properly tested.

*. TP3
    - implements numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule, middle point
    rule and Simpson rule.
